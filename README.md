# Fresh Please!

I used rune-ks / [meteor-boilerplate](https://github.com/rune-ks/meteor-boilerplate) to get bootstrap 3 into my meteor app from the beginning, because I was having trouble adding it otherwise. It also has iron router and a lot of other ubiquitiously required packages.

This is a teeth sharpening exercise for rapid app development using Meteor JS.
