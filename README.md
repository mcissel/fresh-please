# Fresh Please!

I used rune-ks / [meteor-boilerplate](https://github.com/rune-ks/meteor-boilerplate) to get bootstrap 3 into my meteor app from the beginning, because I was having trouble adding it otherwise. It also has iron router and a lot of other ubiquitiously required packages.
A starting point for MeteorJS applications. Includes iron-router, Bootstrap 3 (now including Glyphicons), Font Awesome, LESS and more.
